The code demonstrates the implementation of the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm, a clustering method that can identify clusters of varying shapes in data based on density. The notebook includes:

Data Loading and Preparation: Data is loaded and preprocessed for clustering.
DBSCAN Algorithm Application: DBSCAN is applied to the data to perform clustering, identifying core points, border points, and noise.
Parameter Tuning: The notebook explores the effects of different parameter settings (eps and min_samples) on clustering outcomes.
Visualization: The clusters formed by DBSCAN are visualized to assess the algorithmâ€™s performance and identify outliers.
Evaluation: The clustering result is evaluated, often using metrics such as silhouette scores to determine the effectiveness of the clustering.
